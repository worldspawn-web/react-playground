    "Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method. In the typical React dataflow, props are the only way that parent components interact with their children. To modify a child, you re-render it with new props. However, there are a few cases where you need to imperatively modify a child outside of the typical dataflow. The child to be modified could be an instance of a React component, or it could be a DOM element. For both of these cases, React provides an escape hatch.",
    "When a piece of information is used for rendering, keep it in state.When a piece of information is only needed by event handlers and changing it doesn't require a re-render, using a ref may be more efficient."
